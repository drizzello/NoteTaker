2026 ok
 

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.149 align:start position:0%
2026 ok
Eh <00:25:39.056><c>because </c><00:25:39.512><c>we </c><00:25:39.968><c>have </c><00:25:40.424><c>3-year </c><00:25:40.880><c>cycles</c>

00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
Eh because we have 3-year cycles

previous meeting and this one the proposals are closed
i.e. <00:25:55.980><c>let's </c><00:25:56.760><c>say </c><00:25:57.540><c>that </c><00:25:58.320><c>no</c>

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
more proposals are accepted because the
 

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.590 align:start position:0%
more proposals are accepted because the
path <00:26:02.199><c>to </c><00:26:02.798><c>get </c><00:26:03.397><c>a</c>

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
path to get a
 

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.950 align:start position:0%
path to get a
proposal <00:26:03.791><c>into </c><00:26:03.982><c>the </c><00:26:04.173><c>standard </c><00:26:04.364><c>is </c><00:26:04.555><c>quite</c>

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
proposal into the standard is quite
 

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.750 align:start position:0%
proposal into the standard is quite
long <00:26:05.284><c>in </c><00:26:05.608><c>fact </c><00:26:05.932><c>I'll </c><00:26:06.256><c>explain </c><00:26:06.580><c>it </c><00:26:06.904><c>a </c><00:26:07.228><c>bit </c><00:26:07.552><c>later </c><00:26:07.876><c>and</c>

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
long in fact I'll explain it a bit later and
 

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.149 align:start position:0%
long in fact I'll explain it a bit later and
and  <00:26:10.184><c>so </c><00:26:10.608><c>it </c><00:26:11.032><c>makes </c><00:26:11.456><c>no </c><00:26:11.880><c>sense </c><00:26:12.304><c>to </c><00:26:12.728><c>accept </c><00:26:13.152><c>in</c>

00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
and  so it makes no sense to accept in
 

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:17.190 align:start position:0%
and  so it makes no sense to accept in
2025 <00:26:14.499><c>something </c><00:26:14.839><c>that </c><00:26:15.179><c>has </c><00:26:15.519><c>to </c><00:26:15.859><c>be </c><00:26:16.199><c>finished </c><00:26:16.539><c>has </c><00:26:16.879><c>to</c>

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
2025 something that has to be finished has to
 

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.110 align:start position:0%
2025 something that has to be finished has to
be <00:26:17.457><c>done </c><00:26:17.714><c>and </c><00:26:17.971><c>finished </c><00:26:18.228><c>in </c><00:26:18.485><c>the </c><00:26:18.742><c>standard </c><00:26:18.999><c>in</c>

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
be done and finished in the standard in
 

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.190 align:start position:0%
be done and finished in the standard in
2026 <00:26:19.872><c>so </c><00:26:20.624><c>basically </c><00:26:21.376><c>there </c><00:26:22.128><c>are </c><00:26:22.880><c>three</c>

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
2026 so basically there are three
 

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.750 align:start position:0%
2026 so basically there are three
meetings <00:26:23.520><c>for </c><00:26:23.840><c>To </c><00:26:24.160><c>have </c><00:26:24.480><c>new </c><00:26:24.800><c>things </c><00:26:25.120><c>for </c><00:26:25.440><c>three</c>

00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
make some constructors disappear And
 

00:29:53.679 --> 00:29:58.430 align:start position:0%
make some constructors disappear And
okay <00:29:53.951><c>if </c><00:29:54.223><c>you </c><00:29:54.495><c>want </c><00:29:54.767><c>I'll </c><00:29:55.039><c>also </c><00:29:55.311><c>tell </c><00:29:55.583><c>you </c><00:29:55.855><c>the </c><00:29:56.127><c>proposal </c><00:29:56.399><c>is</c>

00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay if you want I'll also tell you the proposal is
 

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.630 align:start position:0%
okay if you want I'll also tell you the proposal is

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
So the String strings in C are
 

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.230 align:start position:0%
So the String strings in C are

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
presented by a pointer remove the
 

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.190 align:start position:0%
presented by a pointer remove the

constructor that takes an integer Yes no
 

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.470 align:start position:0%
constructor that takes an integer Yes no
remove <00:30:08.439><c>the </c><00:30:08.678><c>constructor </c><00:30:08.917><c>that </c><00:30:09.156><c>takes </c><00:30:09.395><c>a</c>

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
remove the constructor that takes a
 

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:14.669 align:start position:0%
remove the constructor that takes a

00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
pointer ah uh ok and only have the
 

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:17.029 align:start position:0%
pointer ah uh ok and only have the
construction <00:30:15.119><c>when </c><00:30:15.559><c>you </c><00:30:15.999><c>also </c><00:30:16.439><c>know </c><00:30:16.879><c>the</c>

00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
construction when you also know the
 

00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:20.149 align:start position:0%
construction when you also know the
length <00:30:17.379><c>or </c><00:30:17.719><c>in </c><00:30:18.059><c>any </c><00:30:18.399><c>case </c><00:30:18.739><c>you </c><00:30:19.079><c>have </c><00:30:19.419><c>a </c><00:30:19.759><c>maximum</c>

So <00:30:22.056><c>if </c><00:30:22.433><c>not  </c><00:30:22.810><c>you </c><00:30:23.187><c>have </c><00:30:23.564><c>that </c><00:30:23.941><c>if </c><00:30:24.318><c>you </c><00:30:24.695><c>only </c><00:30:25.072><c>have</c>

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
So if not  you have that if you only have
 

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.669 align:start position:0%
So if not  you have that if you only have
the <00:30:25.919><c>pointer </c><00:30:26.358><c>at </c><00:30:26.797><c>least </c><00:30:27.236><c>ask </c><00:30:27.675><c>to </c><00:30:28.114><c>have </c><00:30:28.553><c>a</c>

00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
the pointer at least ask to have a
 

00:30:28.679 --> 00:30:31.149 align:start position:0%
the pointer at least ask to have a

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
Safe operation That is then make
 

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.590 align:start position:0%

you have a pointer Assign it to a

overload the comma operator Eh I don't
 

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.589 align:start position:0%
overload the comma operator Eh I don't
remember <00:36:15.312><c>exactly </c><00:36:15.584><c>the </c><00:36:15.856><c>order </c><00:36:16.128><c>in </c><00:36:16.400><c>which</c>

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
they did things if they deprecated it
 

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.589 align:start position:0%
they did things if they deprecated it
if <00:36:18.766><c>they </c><00:36:19.132><c>deprecated </c><00:36:19.498><c>it </c><00:36:19.864><c>only </c><00:36:20.230><c>in </c><00:36:20.596><c>some</c>

if they deprecated it only in some
 

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:23.750 align:start position:0%
if they deprecated it only in some
in <00:36:21.899><c>some </c><00:36:22.199><c>moments </c><00:36:22.499><c>But </c><00:36:22.799><c>this </c><00:36:23.099><c>was </c><00:36:23.399><c>needed</c>

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
in some moments But this was needed
 

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.230 align:start position:0%
in some moments But this was needed
because <00:36:23.933><c>in </c><00:36:24.106><c>one </c><00:36:24.279><c>version </c><00:36:24.452><c>they </c><00:36:24.625><c>deprecated </c><00:36:24.798><c>it</c>

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
because in one version they deprecated it
 

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.550 align:start position:0%
because in one version they deprecated it
in <00:36:25.470><c>the </c><00:36:25.700><c>next </c><00:36:25.930><c>version </c><00:36:26.160><c>they</c>

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
in the next version they
 

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.710 align:start position:0%
in the next version they
removed <00:36:26.873><c>it </c><00:36:27.186><c>in </c><00:36:27.499><c>the </c><00:36:27.812><c>next </c><00:36:28.125><c>version </c><00:36:28.438><c>They</c>

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
removed it in the next version They
 

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.710 align:start position:0%
removed it in the next version They
introduced <00:36:29.040><c>the </c><00:36:29.360><c>possibility </c><00:36:29.680><c>to </c><00:36:30.000><c>put</c>

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
introduced the possibility to put
 

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.630 align:start position:0%
introduced the possibility to put
multiple <00:36:31.400><c>separate </c><00:36:32.080><c>parameters </c><00:36:32.760><c>instead  </c><00:36:33.440><c>from</c>

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
multiple separate parameters instead  from
 

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.470 align:start position:0%
multiple separate parameters instead  from
comma  <00:36:34.064><c>in </c><00:36:34.488><c>the </c><00:36:34.912><c>square </c><00:36:35.336><c>bracket </c><00:36:35.760><c>operator</c>

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
comma  in the square bracket operator
 

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.430 align:start position:0%
comma  in the square bracket operator
so <00:36:37.011><c>now </c><00:36:37.542><c>in </c><00:36:38.073><c>c+ </c><00:36:38.604><c>plus3 </c><00:36:39.135><c>we </c><00:36:39.666><c>can </c><00:36:40.197><c>make</c>

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
so now in c+ plus3 we can make
 

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.750 align:start position:0%
so now in c+ plus3 we can make
matrices <00:36:41.760><c>with</c>

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
matrices with

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
square brackets Ok ok It was a path that
 

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.470 align:start position:0%
square brackets Ok ok It was a path that
required <00:36:46.833><c>three </c><00:36:47.146><c>versions </c><00:36:47.459><c>of </c><00:36:47.772><c>c+ </c><00:36:48.085><c>Plus </c><00:36:48.398><c>to</c>

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
required three versions of c+ Plus to
 

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.750 align:start position:0%
required three versions of c+ Plus to

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
get to Ok ok Okay the deprecated
 

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.870 align:start position:0%
get to Ok ok Okay the deprecated

00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
intermediate step ok So  there is a Warning if you
 

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.069 align:start position:0%
intermediate step ok So  there is a Warning if you

00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
use it removed is the next time but
 

00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:03.349 align:start position:0%
use it removed is the next time but
in <00:37:01.495><c>fact </c><00:37:01.911><c>my </c><00:37:02.327><c>proposal </c><00:37:02.743><c>is </c><00:37:03.159><c>to</c>

00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
in fact my proposal is to
 

00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:06.430 align:start position:0%
in fact my proposal is to
remove <00:37:03.639><c>but </c><00:37:03.919><c>it </c><00:37:04.199><c>is </c><00:37:04.479><c>not </c><00:37:04.759><c>said </c><00:37:05.039><c>that </c><00:37:05.319><c>step </c><00:37:05.599><c>1</c>

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
remove but it is not said that step 1
 

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.230 align:start position:0%
remove but it is not said that step 1
is <00:37:06.735><c>we </c><00:37:07.030><c>remove </c><00:37:07.325><c>it </c><00:37:07.620><c>maybe </c><00:37:07.915><c>step </c><00:37:08.210><c>1 </c><00:37:08.505><c>will </c><00:37:08.800><c>be</c>

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
is we remove it maybe step 1 will be
 

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.230 align:start position:0%
is we remove it maybe step 1 will be

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
as the comma operator works that is to
 

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.390 align:start position:0%

be a preliminary discussion in
 

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:35.190 align:start position:0%
be a preliminary discussion in
which <00:56:32.870><c>it </c><00:56:33.060><c>is </c><00:56:33.250><c>known </c><00:56:33.440><c>that </c><00:56:33.630><c>that </c><00:56:33.820><c>ficur </c><00:56:34.010><c>is </c><00:56:34.200><c>important</c>

00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
which it is known that that ficur is important
 

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.190 align:start position:0%
which it is known that that ficur is important
it <00:56:35.471><c>must </c><00:56:35.742><c>pass </c><00:56:36.013><c>at </c><00:56:36.284><c>that </c><00:56:36.555><c>moment</c>

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
it must pass at that moment
 

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.990 align:start position:0%
it must pass at that moment
So <00:56:38.531><c>it </c><00:56:38.862><c>is </c><00:56:39.193><c>very </c><00:56:39.524><c>rare </c><00:56:39.855><c>that </c><00:56:40.186><c>this </c><00:56:40.517><c>happens</c>

00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
So it is very rare that this happens
 

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.870 align:start position:0%

exactly <01:03:52.099><c>and </c><01:03:52.359><c>good </c><01:03:52.619><c>that </c><01:03:52.879><c>we </c><01:03:53.139><c>caught </c><01:03:53.399><c>it </c><01:03:53.659><c>right </c><01:03:53.919><c>away</c>

01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
exactly and good that we caught it right away
 

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.750 align:start position:0%
exactly and good that we caught it right away
because <01:03:54.935><c>someone </c><01:03:55.350><c>could </c><01:03:55.765><c>have </c><01:03:56.180><c>versed </c><01:03:56.595><c>a</c>

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
because someone could have versed a

01:05:29.789 --> 01:05:29.799 align:start position:0%
then we realized  I realize that it wasn't
 

01:05:29.799 --> 01:05:33.829 align:start position:0%
then we realized  I realize that it wasn't
eh <01:05:30.319><c>it </c><01:05:30.839><c>wasn't </c><01:05:31.359><c>feasible </c><01:05:31.879><c>it </c><01:05:32.399><c>wasn't </c><01:05:32.919><c>it </c><01:05:33.439><c>wasn't</c>

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
eh it wasn't feasible it wasn't it wasn't
 

01:05:33.839 --> 01:05:38.390 align:start position:0%
eh it wasn't feasible it wasn't it wasn't
interesting <01:05:34.631><c>for </c><01:05:35.423><c>the </c><01:05:36.215><c>committee </c><01:05:37.007><c>ok </c><01:05:37.799><c>The</c>

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
interesting for the committee ok The
 

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.150 align:start position:0%
interesting for the committee ok The
committee <01:05:38.687><c>considers </c><01:05:38.974><c>it </c><01:05:39.261><c>a </c><01:05:39.548><c>niche </c><01:05:39.835><c>thing</c>

01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
committee considers it a niche thing
 

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:43.870 align:start position:0%
committee considers it a niche thing
and <01:05:40.462><c>it's </c><01:05:40.764><c>difficult </c><01:05:41.066><c>to </c><01:05:41.368><c>make </c><01:05:41.670><c>them </c><01:05:41.972><c>change </c><01:05:42.274><c>their </c><01:05:42.576><c>mind </c><01:05:42.878><c>Ok</c>

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
this too much because then maybe
 

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.150 align:start position:0%
this too much because then maybe
we'll <01:06:06.025><c>go </c><01:06:06.290><c>on </c><01:06:06.555><c>and </c><01:06:06.820><c>on </c><01:06:07.085><c>about </c><01:06:07.350><c>What </c><01:06:07.615><c>is </c><01:06:07.880><c>too</c>

go to initialize the variable if on the

01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:45.350 align:start position:0%
first use you already know which branch
they

01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
they
 

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.310 align:start position:0%
they
initialized <01:22:45.688><c>it </c><01:22:46.016><c>and </c><01:22:46.344><c>therefore  </c><01:22:46.672><c>we </c><01:22:47.000><c>can</c>

01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
initialized it and therefore  we can
 

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.669 align:start position:0%

01:22:48.679 --> 01:22:50.830 align:start position:0%

I <01:22:48.999><c>initialize </c><01:22:49.319><c>everything</c>

01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
I initialize everything
 

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.070 align:start position:0%
I initialize everything

01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
m everything that is not

So <01:22:55.788><c>in </c><01:22:56.096><c>reality </c><01:22:56.404><c>what </c><01:22:56.712><c>you </c><01:22:57.020><c>are </c><01:22:57.328><c>going </c><01:22:57.636><c>to</c>

01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
So in reality what you are going to
 

01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.350 align:start position:0%
So in reality what you are going to
initialize <01:22:58.096><c>is </c><01:22:58.392><c>only </c><01:22:58.688><c>a </c><01:22:58.984><c>fraction </c><01:22:59.280><c>of</c>

01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%

01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
what you would have initialized 40 years
 

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:04.430 align:start position:0%
what you would have initialized 40 years
ago <01:23:01.791><c>Ok </c><01:23:02.102><c>So </c><01:23:02.413><c>the </c><01:23:02.724><c>reason </c><01:23:03.035><c>that </c><01:23:03.346><c>there </c><01:23:03.657><c>was </c><01:23:03.968><c>40 </c><01:23:04.279><c>years</c>

01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
ago Ok So the reason that there was 40 years
 

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.750 align:start position:0%
ago Ok So the reason that there was 40 years
ago <01:23:04.773><c>for </c><01:23:05.106><c>not </c><01:23:05.439><c>initializing  </c><01:23:05.772><c>the </c><01:23:06.105><c>variables </c><01:23:06.438><c>is</c>

01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
ago for not initializing  the variables is
 

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:12.470 align:start position:0%
ago for not initializing  the variables is
a <01:23:07.244><c>little </c><01:23:07.728><c>bit </c><01:23:08.212><c>decayed </c><01:23:08.696><c>it </c><01:23:09.180><c>is </c><01:23:09.664><c>a </c><01:23:10.148><c>lot </c><01:23:10.632><c>reduced</c>

01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit decayed it is a lot reduced
 

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.790 align:start position:0%
a little bit decayed it is a lot reduced
m <01:23:13.104><c>So </c><01:23:13.728><c>there </c><01:23:14.352><c>are </c><01:23:14.976><c>some </c><01:23:15.600><c>things</c>

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
m So there are some things
 

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.590 align:start position:0%
m So there are some things
that <01:23:15.979><c>are </c><01:23:16.158><c>Legacy</c>

01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
there is a bit  of tension there that is the fact

there is a bit  of tension there that is the fact

01:28:07.629 --> 01:28:07.639 align:start position:0%
is that if you remove all the undefine

01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
assume that pointer is not

01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
Null pointer is define behavior so
 

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:20.470 align:start position:0%
Null pointer is define behavior so
I <01:29:17.711><c>can </c><01:29:17.982><c>assume </c><01:29:18.253><c>that </c><01:29:18.524><c>it </c><01:29:18.795><c>is </c><01:29:19.066><c>not </c><01:29:19.337><c>Null </c><01:29:19.608><c>and </c><01:29:19.879><c>and</c>

01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
I can assume that it is not Null and and
 

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.669 align:start position:0%
I can assume that it is not Null and and
this <01:29:20.826><c>is </c><01:29:21.172><c>a </c><01:29:21.518><c>problem </c><01:29:21.864><c>because </c><01:29:22.210><c>before </c><01:29:22.556><c>you</c>

01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
this is a problem because before you

I <01:34:36.500><c>went </c><01:34:37.200><c>Ok </c><01:34:37.900><c>ok </c><01:34:38.600><c>no </c><01:34:39.300><c>interesting </c><01:34:40.000><c>but  </c><01:34:40.700><c>there </c><01:34:41.400><c>are</c>

01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
I went Ok ok no interesting but  there are
 

01:34:41.639 --> 01:34:44.830 align:start position:0%
I went Ok ok no interesting but  there are
so <01:34:42.059><c>many </c><01:34:42.479><c>things</c>

01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
 

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:49.070 align:start position:0%
 
that <01:34:45.352><c>ok </c><01:34:45.864><c>It </c><01:34:46.376><c>would </c><01:34:46.888><c>be </c><01:34:47.400><c>from</c>

01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
that ok It would be from
 

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:53.750 align:start position:0%
that ok It would be from
the <01:34:50.080><c>now</c>

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
nothing <01:34:54.265><c>no </c><01:34:54.770><c>so </c><01:34:55.275><c>the </c><01:34:55.780><c>idea </c><01:34:56.285><c>is </c><01:34:56.790><c>Rust </c><01:34:57.295><c>has </c><01:34:57.800><c>a</c>

01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
nothing no so the idea is Rust has a
 

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:01.030 align:start position:0%
nothing no so the idea is Rust has a
small <01:34:58.359><c>problem </c><01:34:58.798><c>has </c><01:34:59.237><c>a</c>

01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
small problem has a
 

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.669 align:start position:0%
small problem has a
model <01:35:01.586><c>in </c><01:35:02.132><c>general </c><01:35:02.678><c>very </c><01:35:03.224><c>different </c><01:35:03.770><c>from </c><01:35:04.316><c>c+</c>

01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
model in general very different from c+
 

01:35:04.679 --> 01:35:07.109 align:start position:0%
model in general very different from c+
Plus <01:35:04.919><c>so </c><01:35:05.159><c>it </c><01:35:05.399><c>is </c><01:35:05.639><c>difficult </c><01:35:05.879><c>to </c><01:35:06.119><c>take</c>

01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
Plus so it is difficult to take
 

01:35:07.119 --> 01:35:10.470 align:start position:0%
Plus so it is difficult to take
integrate <01:35:07.570><c>Rust </c><01:35:08.021><c>and </c><01:35:08.472><c>c+ </c><01:35:08.923><c>Plus </c><01:35:09.374><c>together </c><01:35:09.825><c>a </c><01:35:10.276><c>little</c>

01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
integrate Rust and c+ Plus together a little
 

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:12.790 align:start position:0%
integrate Rust and c+ Plus together a little
because <01:35:10.742><c>there </c><01:35:11.004><c>is  </c><01:35:11.266><c>the </c><01:35:11.528><c>model </c><01:35:11.790><c>of </c><01:35:12.052><c>the </c><01:35:12.314><c>borrow</c>

01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
because there is  the model of the borrow
 

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:15.189 align:start position:0%
because there is  the model of the borrow

rest of the thing but even if you want to
 

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:21.229 align:start position:0%

01:35:27.119 --> 01:35:31.590 align:start position:0%

01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
crap and it can do crap even

01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
the same memory space m so it's

fall for it there  he noticed Exactly And
 

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:20.790 align:start position:0%
fall for it there  he noticed Exactly And
then <01:45:18.524><c>he </c><01:45:18.728><c>also </c><01:45:18.932><c>has </c><01:45:19.136><c>he </c><01:45:19.340><c>also </c><01:45:19.544><c>has </c><01:45:19.748><c>std2 </c><01:45:19.952><c>as </c><01:45:20.156><c>a</c>
